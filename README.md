Let me know which repos you'd like me to draft first. I can create complete READMEs with proper structure, badges, and contribution guidelines.

Here's what I'm thinking for a starter pack:

| Repo | What I'd Include |
|------|------------------|
| **`.github`** | CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, issue/PR templates, funding.yml |
| **`mma-data-standards`** | JSON schemas for fighters, bouts, events, weight classes; versioning strategy; example payloads |
| **`awesome-combat-sports-tech`** | Curated sections for APIs, datasets, tools, media, research papers |
| **`combat-sports-glossary`** | Multi-format glossary (JSON, YAML, Markdown), term mappings across disciplines |
| **`medical-clearance-schemas`** | FHIR-aligned schemas, pre-fight/post-fight requirements, jurisdiction variations |

Pick one or two to start, or say "all" and I'll create a bundle you can review and push.
